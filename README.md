## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned about span elements and how they're inline elements as opposed to block elements. This came into play when I wanted to style a text with a background color without having the color run the entire width of the div.
